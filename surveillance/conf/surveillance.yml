advanced:
    ##Enable this option if you want to have a fixed width of all your camera streams,
    ##By default rpisurv autocalculates this value, this can cause streams to get "stretched",
    ##if this value exceeds the available height, rpisurv will fallback to autocalculation
    #fixed_width: 500

    ##Enable this option if you want to have a fixed height for all your camera streams,

    ##if this value exceeds the available height, rpisurv will fallback to autocalculation
    #fixed_height: 500

    #Rpisurv sends usage stats to it's statistics server to give the rpisurv community an idea how widespread this software is being used
    #No performance impact is measured when using this option, no sensitive data is being sent. All data is anonymised.
    #By default this is true
    #update_stats: True

    #By default rpisurv checks every 25 seconds if it needs to redraw the screen
    #interval_check_status: 25

#These are fallbacks if autodection fails;
#Normally you do not need to configure these
fallbacks:
    resolution:
