  #Rpisurv sends usage stats to it's statistics server to give the rpisurv community an idea how widespread this software is being used
  #No performance impact is measured when using this option, no sensitive data is being sent. All data is anonymised.
  #By default this is false
  #update_stats: False

  #By default Rpisurv will cache the next screen in the rotation to speed up the future rotation event.
  #However, there are some cases where Rpisurv will  force disable caching of the next screen:
  #- When dual displays are detected, caching of next screen will be automatically disabled on both displays to free up resources for actual streams
  #  secondly pygame is not compatible with 2 displays, see https://github.com/pygame/pygame/issues/2356
  #- When an imageurl is used in a screen then caching of the next screen will be automatically disabled because underlying software (pygame) is currently not compatible with our layered-caching approach
  #- When a human sets this setting to "enable_opportunistic_caching_next_screen: False" (because he or she wants to exchange caching resources for more visible streams)
  #By default this is True
  #enable_opportunistic_caching_next_screen: True

  #By default rpisurv will check memory usage, set to False to skip memory usage check
  #By default this is True
  #memory_usage_check: True

  #By default rpisurv checks every 19 seconds if all cameras on the current active screen are still connectable or if unconnectable become connectable
  #If there is a change in connectable/unconnectable screens rpisurv will update the screen with the new situation
  #In the case of dual displays, it does check this independently every 19s for both active screens (2 screens are active on dual displays setup)
  interval_check_status: 19

#These are fallbacks if autodection fails;
#Normally you do not need to configure these as rpisurv tries to autodetect this
