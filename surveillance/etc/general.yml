  #By default rpisurv checks every 15 seconds if all cameras on the current active screen are still connectable or if unconnectable become connectable
  #If there is a change in connectable/unconnectable screens rpisurv will update the screen with the new situation
  #In the case of dual displays, it does check this independently every interval_check_status seconds for both active screens (2 screens are active on dual displays setup)
