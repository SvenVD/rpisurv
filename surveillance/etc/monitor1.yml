  #Rpisurv will rotate over the following screens in the order they are configured here, if you only define one screen no rotation will happen

  #If you enable this option no auto rotation will happen, but you will still be able to select a screen by pressing and holding a Function Key (F1-F12) or numpad keys

#      #What follows is documentation about every option that is available and where and how it can be used
#      #Below config are examples, the urls specified will not work, you need to configure your own urls.
#      #######################################################################################################
#
#      #Documentation example SCREEN 1
#      #This will show a 2x2 if all streams are connectable,
#      #Force this screen to be shown by pressing and holding F1 or keypad 0
#    - streams:
#        - url: "https://images.rpisurv.net/example.png"
#          #To specify this url is not a camera stream but an image stream please set imageurl to true for this url
#          imageurl: true
#        - url: "rtsp://<user>:<password>@<ip or dnsname>:<port>/videoMain"
#          #You can also configure http or https streams like for example mjpeg streams
#        - url: "http://<ip or dnsname>:<port>/suffix"
#        - url: "rtsp://<user>:<password>@<ip or dnsname>:<port>/play1.sdp"

#      #Documentation example SCREEN 2
#      #Force this screen to be shown by pressing and holding F2 or keypad 1
#    - streams:
#          #Dlink dcs-5222l example
#        - url: "rtsp://<user>:<password>@<ip or dnsname>:<port>/play1.sdp"
#
#          #OPTIONAL AND ADVANCED PER CAMERASTREAM/URL OPTIONS:
#
#          #Increase probe_timeout if you have streams that are slow to connect to. If they longer then probe_timeout seconds then rpisurv will consider them unconnectable
#          #Default to 3 seconds
#          probe_timeout: 3
#
#          #Optional: freeform_advanced_mpv_options, most vlc options can be passed directly here.
#          #This is for advanced usage only, not all combinations have been tested
#          freeform_advanced_mpv_options: "--rtsp-transport=tcp"
#
#          #Optional: enableaudio:
#          #To enable audio for this stream try setting this to True, the default is False
#          enableaudio: False
#
#          #Optional and advanced option: force_coordinates:
#          #If you are not happy with the pre-calculated position on the screen of a particular stream then you can override it with this option
#          #Remember that rpisurv autocalculation can also be influenced by nr_of_columns option, which is a much easier option then using force_coordinates if all you want to do is using more or less columns
#          #Note: Once you start using force_coordinates, the layout of this particular screen becomes the responsibility of the user
#          #Note2: rpisurv will continue to draw other streams with the pre-calculated values if they do not have force_coordinates set.
#          #This can cause overlap with other streams but the user can correct this by manually calculating and setting the position of the other camera streams with force_coordinates
#          #Note3: This works transparently with rotation of screens, every screen can have a different layout
#          #force_coordinates: [upperleft corner x position, upperleft corner y position, downright corner x position, downright corner y position]
#          #Example see here: https://gist.github.com/SvenVD/5c82acbb96dfb697e5e2d2420ab73ad9
#          force_coordinates: [0, 800, 600, 1080]
#
#          #You can use then showontop in combination with force_coordinates to create a picture in picture view (one video overlaying the other ) see demo config for example
#          showontop: False

#
#      #OPTIONAL AND ADVANCED PER SCREEN OPTIONS, YOU CAN CONFIGURE THIS PER SCREEN, IF NOT CONFIGURED A DEFAULT VALUE WILL BE USED
#
#      #NOT recommended to enable disable_probing_for_all_streams, it disables the removal of dead feeds which also disables auto-rearranging the screen layout.
#      #Also if using multiple screens, enabling this will slow down rotation of one screen to the next if there are unconnectable streams
#      #Defaults to False
#      disable_probing_for_all_streams: False
#
#      #How many columns you want the program to use, it will autocalculate the amount of row needed based on the resolution of your screen
#      #Default = 2
#      nr_of_columns: 2
#
#      #This is how long this screen will be shown each rotation.
#      #If this is set to a very low value then it can happen that building up the active and/or the cached screen takes longer then this duration,
#      #in that case the building and caching needs to finish first before timer will be expired and next screen is shown
#      #Defaults to 30
#      duration: 30
#
#      #Documentation example SCREEN 3
#      #This will show a 1x3 on first row + 1 stream on second row if all streams are connectable
#      #Force this screen to be shown by pressing and holding F3 or keypad 2
